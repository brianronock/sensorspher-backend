Summary:
This service handles notifications like email and push notifications. It's designed but not yet integrated into your project.
Key Components:
- `sendNotification`: Function that sends notifications based on the `type` (email or push). Currently, it only logs the payload, but you can expand it with real email or push notification services.
Context:
- Backend: It will be triggered when certain events happen, like sensors reporting extreme values.
- Whole Project: Can be integrated with a notification system to alert users when certain sensor thresholds are met.

      // Code to send push notification
      console.log('Sending push notification:', payload)

      console.log('Unknown notification type')
